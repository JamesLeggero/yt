# YDL Helper

This is a small utility for quickly sourcing YT audio to your desktop. Make sure you have [youtube-dl](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed as well. As well as Node and Python.

## Instructions

Once you've installed y-dl and ffmpeg, you can clone yt into your projects folder. From that yt root folder, run "npm i -g" to install globally.

Anywhere in the terminal, run:

yt "{youtube link}>" (include the quotes) and it will download the audio to WAV format to your desktop.

To uninstall, run "npm uninstall -g" from the yt folder.
